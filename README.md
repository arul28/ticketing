The landing page of our program is the main page where users can chose to either login as an admin or a passenger. The admin login is written above. As an admin you can view your own details, and right underneath you have other options related to an Admin. You can edit your own profile, or conduct other actions such as view/edit/create trains, tickets, passengers. You can logout once you are done. The other option is to login as a passenger. When you click the login button you can either sign up or sign in. Once logged in, users can view their profile detials, and then choose to edit it too. Users can vie a list of trains which are put into the system by admins. Users can book a train and create a train ticekt. If they head back to their user dashboard, users can view a list of all their tickets. Also on their dashboard, users can select the reviews option. Users can only leave reviews if their train has reached their destination and their train ride is complete.
